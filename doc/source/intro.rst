What is Tadbit?
===============

TADBit is a computational package that deals with 3C-based data (more specifically Hi-C data) to detect Topologically Associating Domain (TAD) borders and to further analyze TADs by: i) the identification of conserved TAD borders and ii) the definition of sets of TADs sharing structural features iii) the three-dimensional modeling of the chromatin.

Hi-C experiments generate genomic interaction data that is usually summarized at the chromosome level. TADBit is built around the concept of chromosome, and uses it as a central item to compare different Hi-C experiments. The library has been designed to be used by researchers with minimal level of expertise in computer science; the all-in-one scripts provided in TADBit allow to run a full analysis in one single command line, while advanced users may produce their own programs using TADBit as a complementary tool.
