Welcome to TADbit's documentation!
==================================

TADbit is a computational package that deals with 3C-based data (more specifically Hi-C data) to detect Topologically A
ssociating Domain (TAD) borders and to further analyze TADs by: i) the identification of conserved TAD borders and ii) 
the definition of sets of TADs sharing structural features iii) the three-dimensional modeling of the chromatin.

Hi-C experiments generate genomic interaction data that is usually summarized at the chromosome level. TADbit is built 
around the concept of chromosome, and uses it as a central item to compare different Hi-C experiments. The library has 
been designed to be used by researchers with minimal level of expertise in computer science; the all-in-one scripts pro
vided in TADbit allow to run a full analysis in one single command line, while advanced users may produce their own pro
grams using TADbit as a complementary tool.
