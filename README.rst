TADbit is a computational package that precesses and analyze Hi-C data to detect Topologically Associating Domain (TAD) borders. The TAD analysis performed in TADbit  allows to:

#. identify conserved TAD borders
#. define sets of TADs sharing structural features
#. model the three-dimensional structures of selected TADs

Hi-C experiments generate genomic interaction between loci located in the same or in different chromosomes. TADbit is built around the concept of a chromosome, and uses it as a central item to store and compare different Hi-C experiments. The library has been designed to be used by researchers with no expertise in computer science. All-in-one scripts provided in TADbit allow to run the full analysis using one single command line; advanced users may produce their own programs using TADbit as a complementary library.
