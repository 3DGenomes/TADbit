TADbit is a complete Python library to deal with all steps to analyze,
model and explore 3C-based data. With TADbit the user can map FASTQ
files to obtain raw interaction binned matrices (Hi-C like matrices),
normalize and correct interaction matrices, identify adn compare the
so-called Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), build 3D models
from the interaction matrices, and finally, extract structural
properties from the models. TADbit is complemented by TADkit for
visualizing 3D models.

Hi-C experiments generate genomic interaction between loci located in
the same or in different chromosomes. TADbit is built around the
concept of a chromosome, and uses it as a central item to store and
compare different Hi-C experiments. The library has been designed to
be used by researchers with no expertise in computer
science. All-in-one scripts provided in TADbit allow to run the full
analysis using one single command line; advanced users may produce
their own programs using TADbit as a complementary library.
